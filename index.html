        <p>For the first ten years of my career, I worked for Massimo Vignelli, a designer who is legendary for using a very limited number of typefaces. 
          Between 1980 and 1990, most of my projects were set in five fonts: Helvetica (naturally), Futura, Garamond No. 3, Century Expanded, and, of course, Bodoni.

              <p>For Massimo, this was an ideological choice, an ethical imperative. "In the new computer age," he once wrote, "the proliferation of typefaces and type 
                manipulations represents a new level of visual pollution threatening our culture. Out of thousands of typefaces, all we need are a few basic ones, and trash
                  the rest." For me, it became a time-saving device. Why spend hours choosing between Bembo, Sabon and Garamond No. 3 every time you needed a Venetian Roman? 
                  For most people — my mom, for instance — these were distinctions without differences. Why not just commit to Garamond No. 3 and never think about it again? 
                  My Catholic school education must have well prepared me for this kind of moral clarity. I accepted it gratefully.

              <p>Then, after a decade, I left my first job. Suddenly I could use any typeface I wanted, and I went nuts. On one of my first projects, I used 37 different fonts on
                16 pages. My wife, who had attended Catholic school herself, found this all too familiar. She remembered classmates who had switched to public school after eight 
                years under the nuns: freed at last from demure plaid uniforms, they wore the shortest skirts they could find. "Jesus," she said, looking at one of my multiple font
                 demolition derbies. "You've become a real slut, haven't you?"

      <p>It was true. Liberated from monogamy, I became typographically promiscuous. I have since, I think, learned to modulate my behavior — like any substance abuser,
         I learned that binges are time-consuming, costly, and ultimately counterproductive — but I've never gone back to five-typeface sobriety. Those thousands of typefaces
          are still out there, but my recovery has required that I become more discriminating and come up with some answers to this seemingly simple question: why choose a particular
           typeface? Here are thirteen reasons.

            <p><strong>1. Because it works.</strong><br>
              Some typefaces are just perfect for certain things. I've specified exotic fonts for identity programs that work beautifully in headlines and even in text, 
              but sooner or later you have to set that really tiny type at the bottom of the business reply card. This is what Franklin Gothic is for. Careful, though: 
              some typefaces work too well. Frutiger has been used so much for signage programs in hospitals and airports that seeing it now makes me feel that I'm about
                to get diagnosed with a brain tumor or miss the 7:00 to O'Hare.

            <p><strong> 2. Because you like its history.</strong><br>
              I've heard of several projects where the designer found a font that was created the same year the client's organization was founded. This must give the recommendation
                an aura of manifest destiny that is positively irresistible. I haven't had that luck yet, but still try to find the same kind of evocative alignment. For instance, I
                was never a fan of Aldo Novarese's Eurostyle, but I came to love it while working on a monograph on Eero Saarinen: they both share an expressiveness peculiar to the 
                postwar optimism of the 1950's.

              Once I saw a project in a student portfolio that undertook the dubious challenge of redesigning the Tiffany's identity. I particularly disliked the font that was used, and I 
              politely asked what it was. "Oh," came the enthusiastic response, "that's the best part! It's called Tiffany!" On the other hand, Bruce Mau designed Spectacle, the book he 
              created with David Rockwell, using the typeface Rockwell. I thought this was funny.

              Once I was working on a project where the client group included some very strong-minded architects. I picked Cheltenham, an idiosyncratic typeface that was not only well-suited
                to the project's requirements, but was one of the few I know that was designed by an architect, Bertram Goodhue. Recently, I designed a publications program for a girls' school.
                I used a typeface that was designed by a woman and named after another, Zuzana Licko's Mrs. Eaves. In both cases, my clients knew that the public would be completely unaware of 
                the story behind the font selection, but took some comfort in it nonetheless. I did too.

              Sometimes a typeface is already living on the premises when you show up, and it just seems mean to evict it. "We use Baskerville and Univers 65 on all our materials,
               but feel free to make an alternate suggestion." Really? Why bother? It's like one of those shows where the amateur chef is given a turnip, a bag of flour, a leg of 
               lamb and some maple syrup and told to make a dish out of it. Sometimes it's something you've never used before, which makes it even more fun.

              And sometimes it's something you've never used before, for good reason. "We use ITC Eras on all our materials." "Can I make an alternate suggestion?" "No." This is when

              Whenever I want to make words look straightforward, conversational, and smart, I frequently consider Futura, upper and lower case. Why? Not because Paul Renner was straightforward,
               conversational, and smart, although he might have been. No, it's because 45 years ago, Helmut Krone decided to use Futura in Doyle Dane Bernbach's advertising for Volkswagen, and 
               they still use it today. One warning, however: what reminds you of something may remind someone else of something else.

              About 10 years ago, I was asked to redesign the logo for New York magazine. Milton Glaser had based the logo on Bookman Swash Italic, a typeface I found 
              unimaginably dated and ugly. But Glaser's logo had replaced an earlier one by Peter Palazzo that was based on Caslon Italic. I proposed we return to Caslon,
               and distinctly remember saying, "Bookman Swash Italic is always going to look ugly." The other day, I saw something in the office that really caught my eye.
                It was set in Bookman Swash Italic, and it looked great. Ugly, but great.

              Tibor Kalman was fascinated with boring typefaces. "No, this one is too clever, this one is too interesting," he kept saying when showed him the fonts I was
               proposing for his monograph. Anything but a boring typeface, he felt, got in the way of the ideas. We settled on Trade Gothic.

              In design as in fashion, nothing beats bespoke tailoring. I've commissioned custom typefaces from Jonathan Hoefler and Tobias Frere-Jones and Joe Finocchiaro, 
              and we're currently working with Matthew Carter and Chester. It is the ultimate indulgence, but well worth the extra effort. Is this proliferation? I say bring it on.

              Sometimes I think that Massimo Vignelli may be using too many typefaces, not too few. A true fundamentalist requires a monotheistic worldview: one world, one typeface. 
              The designers at Experimental Jetset have made the case for Helvetica. My partner Abbott Miller had a period of life he calls "The Scala Years" when he used that typeface
               almost exclusively. When the time is right, I might make that kind of commitment myself.

               he'd want to go with it. "What about the one called 'I Hate ITC Garamond?'" I asked him. "Would we set it in ITC Garamond?" He looked at me as if I was crazy. "Of course," he said.

         <p>The introduction of programmatic concepts brought to <strong>typography</strong> new experiments, concepts, and the possibility to create <strong>generative typefaces</strong>, capable of adapting to different contexts. This work aims to explore these new creative possibilities in the field of <strong>type design</strong>. Through the implementation of a generative system, we created a <strong>typeface</strong> that adapts its shape to the sentiments expressed in a text. In this project, we used the emotional values of each sentence of a given text to deform the <strong>typographic glyphs</strong> to represent those emotional values. Additionally, and to enable the user to interact with the system, we implemented an application which receives a text as input and, as output, exports the input text composed with our <strong>generative typeface</strong>.

These <br>emotions can also be extracted from the text: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise. To do so, Synesketch uses a method based on the detection of keywords within the text and the application of heuristic rules from dictionaries based on WordNet, emotions, and common abbreviations. For every analysed text, Synesketch returns the weight values for the <br> emotions, the valence (positive or negative), and a general weight value.

            <p><strong>THE 6 EMOTIONAL TYPES</strong><br><br>We aimed to distinguish visually the 6 available emotions: happiness, fear, rage, sadness, disgust, and surprise. The concepts behind the shapes of the glyphs are based on the descriptions made by Darwin in “The expression of the emotions in man and animals” about the reactions of the human being to the respective emotion — the way he/she  express the emotion, through voice, gestures, or the reactions triggered by certain emotions.

             <p>The main goal of the application is to guide the user in the creation of a text composed with the generative typeface. As input, the application receives a text, and as output, the application can export (i) a PDF file in which the inserted text is composed with the resulting glyphs and (ii) a typeface in the True Type Format (TTF), representing the overall emotion of the input text. A video exemplifying the interaction with the application can be seen here.
